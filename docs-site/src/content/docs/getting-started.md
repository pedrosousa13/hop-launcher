## Compatibility

Hop Launcher is designed for **GNOME Shell 45+** with a Wayland-first workflow.

## Local development

From repository root:

```bash
./scripts/install-local.sh
```

This syncs the extension locally, compiles schemas, and reloads the extension.

## Shortcut default

The launcher shortcut is intentionally empty by default.

After installation, set your preferred shortcut in extension preferences, then test opening the launcher.

## TODO later

Add official GNOME Extensions install instructions once the extension is ready for publication there.
