## Fuzzy ranking

Result ranking blends:

- ordered match quality
- contiguous run quality
- boundary boosts
- early-match preference

## Interaction learning

Hop Launcher learns from your interactions:

- apps and windows you select more often receive boosts
- frequent selections for similar fuzzy queries rise higher over time
- behavior stays query-sensitive, not just globally popular

This keeps repeated workflows fast and stable without losing useful fuzzy matching.
