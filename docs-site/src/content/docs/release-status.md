## Current status

The launcher is actively evolving and not yet distributed through official channels.

## Install messaging

The site intentionally uses a placeholder install CTA until official release/distribution is ready.

## TODO later

Add official GNOME Extensions listing and installation instructions once the extension is ready for that channel.

## Site deployment

This docs-site is configured with Astro's Cloudflare adapter for Cloudflare deployment workflows.
