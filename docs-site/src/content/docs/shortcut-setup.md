description: How to assign the launcher keybinding after installation.
order: 2

## Why this is manual

The default shortcut is empty so each user can choose a conflict-free keybinding.

## Set shortcut in preferences

1. Open GNOME Extensions preferences for Hop Launcher.
2. Find **Toggle keybinding**.
3. Click and type the accelerator you want (for example, `Super+Space`).
4. Confirm and test the launcher.

## Validation behavior

- Invalid accelerators are ignored.
- Clearing the field removes the shortcut.
- The previous valid shortcut stays active if a new one is invalid.
