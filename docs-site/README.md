# Hop Launcher Docs Site

Modern Astro docs + storytelling site for Hop Launcher.

## Development

From `docs-site/`:

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Verification

```bash
npm run astro -- check
npm run build

## Notes

- The homepage includes an interactive launcher demo for key query flows.
- Primary CTA is `View Features`.
- Installation messaging is intentionally a placeholder (`Install (Official Channel Soon)`) until official release channels are ready.
